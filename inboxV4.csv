This is almost a week and is unacceptable!! I'm just supposed to go to work for almost a week with a missing front tooth!? I don't understand how you can do business like this. I am not happy and I feel stupid because I have been recommending this office to me. I do have to say that even though there is a large turnover of workers, until now I have been pleased with the service.",0

They did an entire periodic evaluation even after I told them I wasn't interested in that, JUST THE BROKEN ONE!!! I had been there before,They already had full X-rays, I knew my mouth was in rough shape, they already told me that. They charged me $207, Did NOTHING for my tooth and gave me an estimate for 17 THOUSAND $$$$$$ F**KING RIP OFF ARTISTS!!! **** UPDATE**** 2:30 am***Now I can't even sleep because I feel violated, dupped, swindled and ashamed because I just kept opening my mouth and let them have their way with me. I said NO, I DON'T WANT A PERIODONTAL EXAM! she said I have to... Even after the dentist said he couldn't pull the broken one he had them do more X-rays.

  Way way way to expensive, even for rich people or idiots, THE FREE X-RAYS AND EXAM ARE TO GET PEOPLE TO LAY THEIR GAURD DOWN JUST TO GET FOLKS IN THE DOOR TO THEN LEARN ASPEN DENTAL PRICES ARE WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH FOR THE AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE! 
  GONNA THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE I ALLOW MYSELF TO GET SCAMMED WITH THEIR PRICING! 
  LIKE I SAID THE FREE X-RAYS AND EXAM ARE JUST NOTHING MORE THAN A TRICK TO PULL FOLKS INTO THEIR OVER PRICED PROCEDURES!

"Aspen Dental, I reported them to Guardians fraud investigator. I went in for a periodic evaluation and prophy 04/13/2023 today. Horrible tactics. They certainly did not do an exam like a normal dentist, he didn‚Äôt poke with a tool all around my teeth to look for cavities. He only used a dental mirror. They took a ton of I did not ask for. Even during the exam that he did not do like a normal dentist, he said I have really nice teeth. Then they tried to tell me I have gingivitis and bleeding gums when the hygienist never used a tool to measure the gum, she only called out a bunch of numbers. They said I need a special cleaning. My gums never bleed and he never went into my mouth with tools like a normal dental exam he only looked around with the mirror thing and told me I didn‚Äôt have any cavities without even using that tool to poke around your teeth. Then he said he was having his office person talk to me about cost of a treatment plan and mentioned a medicated rinse he wants me to do for two weeks then come back to check my gums. When the office lady came in she had a cost sheet that said I would need to pay $361 dollars to proceed to my cleaning. I said what am I paying for because my insurance covers regular and perio cleanings at 100 percent. She said she would itemize it for me...cancer screening $30.00 electric toothbrush $135.00 she could take off and my cost would be $196. I said what is the $196 for if my insurance covers either a regular or perio prophy at 100 percent she said $34 is the medicated rinse and some irrigation that will be needed during the cleaning. So you are trying to bill me to squirt water at my teeth when that is included in what my insurance pays...I just want to get my cleaning done with what my insurance covers either a regular prophylactic or a perio prophy at 100 percent. They refused to do my cleaning without $196 up front. I said that‚Äôs ok I will reschedule my cleaning elsewhere. I called their Aspen customer service line and advised them that I would be reporting them to Guardians fraud investigator for trying to up sell. I also reported them refusing to do my cleaning. I advised that I will happily get a 2nd opinion if our fraud investigator needs me to get another opinion in order to build his case. I advised that I actually work with our dental product extensively as an employee of Guardian so I am very much aware about what unsavory dental practices are.This includes performing a panoramic without first discussing it with the patient. I am also reporting this to the Wisconsin Attorney Generals office today, I understand Massachusetts has a successful class action law suit for the same unsavory business practices.",0

  Awa",0
I was very disappointed. I wanted my teeth pulled and put back in I thought you made the teeth on site. Also I wasn't prepared for the shock. When they told me hoe much they were I live 60 miles away and I'm going to have to make at least two or three more trips. If there is a cancellation before the 24th please let me know I am having hip replacement on May 9th. And I wanted to have this over with Every one was really nice just not moving as fast as I would like,0

"I was there at 7AM today, April 10th for my cleaning. Nobody was there. Lights out, doors locked, kept looking and never saw anyone. Even left a note on the door. Waited until 7:20AM. Then got a VM saying I was scheduled at 7AM wanting to know if I want to re-schedule. When I called, Peyton told me Brianna was there and saw my car.....and i should have come in. Sorta hard to come in when the door is locked. Extremely disappointed and plan to ask for refund for the rest of the appointments I have scheduled. This was a HUGE inconvenience. I live quite a distance from there. Was told Brianna was there, how I am supposed to know that when the doors are locked and lights out and I didn't see anybody? I am a new patient.",0
"I called 3 different times, and no return call. I had to call my primary physician to get help with Thrush that occurred in my mouth.",0
My dentures still feel like they belong to someone else. They are ill fitting and hurt. I would like to talk about what we can do to get them fitting correctly.,0
"My honest opinion. I feel that they dilly dally way too much and looking to find ways to pad the bill rather than just addressing the patient's problem as soon as possible. And I feel $1,600 to pull a $600 tooth is a little excessive. For the patients that are looking for preventive care and a maintenance program that's all well and fine as we should all take care of our teeth and our body but that's not what I was looking for in today's appointment.",0
"Very nice and they were all friendly. Told you what they were going to do before they did it, they made it a pleasant visit.",0

Reason I said that my mouth is still sore and I think it's because that guy dentist was digging so hard in my gum and steel he did not remove my teeth and then another dentist came in and she started digging in my gums but she got teeth out So with that being said with two people digging down in my gums was not a good experience,0
Oh yeah I forget when the young doctor could not get my teeth out laugh out the room and I'm sitting there with my mouth open waiting for him to return and he never did 5 to 10 minutes went by so I got out the chair went out in the hall he was down that working in someone else's mouth did not have the courtesy to tell me that he could not do the job and someone else was going to take over,0

Another issue is nobody would answer the phone ever for over two weeks, no respond to my messages either. It felt like they were purposely avoiding both. Will continue to see Aspen Dental but make sure I have my card with me so nobody tells me I was mistaken about time of appointment.",0

I tried to get a hold of the telephone number that you gave me and was put on hold for quite a while and I have to tell you that I am very disappointed in the service that I have gotten they did a teeth cleaning and charged me $107 And I could have went to my old dentist and got the same cleaning for about $50. My insurance said there should've been no co-pay and yet they figured away to get $107 out of me and like I said I'm very disappointed in my full teeth That I thought with all the technology it would've been a more comfortable with less gaps for food to get underneath my partial,0

I love Aspen dental I've never been treated with so much kindness in my experience with a dentist I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Aspen dental in Buford Georgia ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,0
Totally unhappy. I went there with a toothache I left with a toothache. I told them when I made the appointment I wanted an extraction that's what the appointment was for. The only thing Aspen dental did for me today was told me how much a lot of stuff that I never even asked for was going to cost me. It was all about money and my ability to pay for services I did not ask for. So disappointed.,0
Loved the staff at Aspen. They took great care to explain everything. They were so polite and friendly. I will definitely go back.,0

"Word for today. Resist the temptation to be irritated or annoyed; it will only undermine your faith and tear you down. Maintain a heart of forgiveness especially toward yourself where you believe you have fallen short of your potential. And, extend grace and forgiveness to others who have offended you. My grace is sufficient. 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. Enjoy your blessed Friday and weekend!ü§ó‚òÅÔ∏èüòé",1

I called the office and was told to bring dentures up so that the lab could see. I went up and was told by the receptionist that they couldn't fix it without an appointment and a full examination and that none was available until next Wednesday. This is almost a week and is unacceptable!! I'm just supposed to go to work for almost a week with a missing front tooth!? I don't understand how you can do business like this. I am not happy and I feel stupid because I have been recommending this office to me.

Perhaps some one would eventually call to at least apologize but the woman was right at the Walmart pharmacy this office is not good at following up and or customer care or communication and those are what I experienced hers was much worse. So yes perhaps someone could follow but not holding my breath. Call 3rd notice no response from anyone at this company ridiculous üò†",0

"Word for today. : Rise up to overcome the obstacles in your way. I have given you the strength and courage to defeat the enemy and walk in victory. You are strong in Me and in the power of My might, says the Lord. Refuse to get discouraged or to accept defeat. You are a mighty warrior dressed for battle. Ephesians 6:12-18 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers ofthe darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench
  all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.

"My experience with Fast Pace is always very good. All the personal are
 professionals and do their job thoroughly.
 I recommend the Clinic to my family and friends.
 The only thing that I would love to see changed is the checking in on
 line. I get no where fast with it! I request a code to verify who I
 am...and send the code back and it starts all over again. It's the most
 frustrating program that I have ever dealt with. Can something be done to
 correct this? I don't think that I am the only one with this problem..but
 maybe I am.
 Otherwise, I give the clinic and personal 5 stars!

"I'm going to put together a full page to run in next Thursday's PCN for our Wrestling team! I would like to wish the ones that are going to State good luck (obviously, we won't know that until Saturday!) and CONGRATULATE the entire team on their accomplishments this season so far! They have made history!!!!
 

 I will need businesses to purchase 2x1 spaces for $20, or you can buy a double space for $35 to fill up the page below a team photo. If your business would like a space, or two, please let me know as soon as possible!
 

 I will also run a final congratulations the week after state, which will be all businesses that participate in this first page, if they would like. Just let me know if you want the first week, or both. Prices will be the same as above for both pages. Deadline will be Monday, Feb. 13 end of day for the first page.
 

 Thanks for showing our Marksmen your support!!!! THEY DESERVE IT!",0

"I need an appointment ha, sore throat , coughing lot of white secretions,vomited 2 times last night due to secretions no fever. Covid test negative at home",0
"A walk-in clinic should be just that. Registering online equates as making appointment, defeating the purpose of ""walk-in"". I witnessed several people leave due to being told there were x number of people ahead of them, therefore a several hours wait to be seen. Seems that if the onliners needed to be seen, they would show at the clinic. Since few, if any, actually showed when clinic opened, I was seen relatively quickly. Staff treated me well and really listened to my concerns.",0
I‚Äôm trying to call the phone number is working,0
Will you be open tomorrow due to the holiday?,0
Hello!! I‚Äôd like to see if I could make an appointment for approximately 2:45,0

"I need you to be aware of comments made by one of your employee‚Äôs, Samantha Candice Dixon, made online in regards to rape victims. She works at the Carthage, TN location. 
 She firmly believes all rape victims should be forced to give birth. She used a 10 year old rape victim as an example it stated it was God‚Äôs plan for her to be raped and bare a child. 
 

 

 IMAGINE your daughter was raped. At 10 YEARS OLD and you took her into a medical office and the person checking you in believes you deserve it. 
 

 I have screenshots in her comments. I‚Äôve also let her know I would be contacting you and she didn‚Äôt seemed bothered. So, unless something is done with this employee, I will question your integrity and I‚Äôd worry for the patients well beings.",0

"My husband and I are the new owners of Skyview Skateshop, located at 49 Union Street in Madisonville, KY. My husband and I recently purchased the business in the hopes to keep the shop alive for the area kids that frequent the shop. We open Tuesday- Saturday where these skaters come and use our free indoor climate controlled mini ramp, and all around hang out. We purchased on Feb 1st and have notice several area kids who want to skate but can't afford the start up. We had one teenage come in with shoes that reminded me of a cartoon character, and we were able to have shoes donated to him. Another broke their board and we knew that they would basically have to stop skating but we had another amazing donor. We have so little in our area for children to enjoy, and one that they look forward to coming to after a long day at school. Several of these kids come from hardship and this is their happy place. We want to be that happy place for other area youth. We currently have 15 skateboard completes with skate tools and wax sponsored waiting to get in the hands to some very deserving kids in our schools. All it takes is $100 to sponsor a board, tool, and wax for a kid that otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to skate, or one that would have to stop because of circumstances out of their control. 
 

 If you donate, we would post it via social media, and we would make sure the child that received this gift would know who it was from. We would ask if they wanted it posted on social media and with the child's permission post it on our sites as not to embarrass them. I grew up not having much but having a few companies that stepped up and helped kids like me out made me the person I am today. If you donate, we can accept it in most forms (cash, checks, PayPal, Venmo, etc.). No amount is too big or small. Help us keep skate alive and give these kids something that is a positive outlet.
