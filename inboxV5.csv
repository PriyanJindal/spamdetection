"Broke a front bottom tooth, called Aspen dental begging for an emergency visit, severe pain for 2 days, had to wait a week. So much for their "" we do emergencies bulls*** They took all kinds of X-rays even though I told them I just wanted to have the broken one pulled. They did an entire periodic evaluation even after I told them I wasn't interested in that, JUST THE BROKEN ONE!!! I had been there before,They already had full X-rays, I knew my mouth was in rough shape, they already told me that. They charged me $207, Did NOTHING for my tooth and gave me an estimate for 17 THOUSAND $$$$$$ F**KING RIP OFF ARTISTS!!! **** UPDATE**** 2:30 am***Now I can't even sleep because I feel violated, dupped, swindled and ashamed because I just kept opening my mouth and let them have their way with me. I said NO, I DON'T WANT A PERIODONTAL EXAM! she said I have to... Even after the dentist said he couldn't pull the broken one he had them do more X-rays. I objected I asked why, ""because the doctor needs them"" and again I opened my stupid mouth and let them do it 😭😭",0
"Why should I went back there and first time they didn't fix him right? That was so into bag second time I went back so the same thing but they won't stay open my mouth without glue them all and the top in top you shouldn't have to and it say there's nothing else I can do and I can get implants and I can't afford implants, so what's the need to talk to do some talking to them because you're not gonna fix them and I can't afford implants in my husband said the top that's the teeth looks like the two Bailey stick out. Yeah he's not happy with them either.",0

"I called for a cleaning, they said that they couldn't do one after calling me in early, they wanted to do deep cleaning half the mouth, the quote was about $500 for the other half $500. I left with x-rays and that's about it. I need to have teeth cleaning because I have to be at a graduation in May. Despite calling and confirming that they would clean my teeth they did not. Nevertheless, the quote for the treatment plan of deep root cleaning even with insurance was $1000, at Jennings- Larson it was 322 and with insurance $121. The price difference was ridiculously off despite the same procedures.",0

I would like my money returned and I will find another dentist! This is not good customer service!!",0
I think your service suck. They tell me one price when I am there then charge a lot more when she comes by herself will be looking for a different dentist. Then dentist was great but customer service sucks.,0
"My experience with aspen dental is that that want a 1000 bucks just to do a thorough cleaning, then another 5000k for root canal and new crown,  
  Way way way to expensive, even for rich people or idiots, THE FREE X-RAYS AND EXAM ARE TO GET PEOPLE TO LAY THEIR GAURD DOWN JUST TO GET FOLKS IN THE DOOR TO THEN LEARN ASPEN DENTAL PRICES ARE WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH FOR THE AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE! 
  GONNA THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE I ALLOW MYSELF TO GET SCAMMED WITH THEIR PRICING! 
  LIKE I SAID THE FREE X-RAYS AND EXAM ARE JUST NOTHING MORE THAN A TRICK TO PULL FOLKS INTO THEIR OVER PRICED PROCEDURES! 
  BET YA'LL GO BROKE AND UNABLE TO CONTINUE BRINGING PEOPLE IN AT THE MENU PRICES! RETHINK THE MENU PRICES, OTHERWISE GET PREPARED TO CLOSE THE DOORS AND GO AWAY! 😭😢😓😰🤣, PRICE GOUGHING MUST GO! YA'LLS PRICES ARE LUDICROUS!",0

"Aspen Dental, I reported them to Guardians fraud investigator. I went in for a periodic evaluation and prophy 04/13/2023 today. Horrible tactics. They certainly did not do an exam like a normal dentist, he didn’t poke with a tool all around my teeth to look for cavities. He only used a dental mirror. They took a ton of I did not ask for. Even during the exam that he did not do like a normal dentist, he said I have really nice teeth. Then they tried to tell me I have gingivitis and bleeding gums when the hygienist never used a tool to measure the gum, she only called out a bunch of numbers. They said I need a special cleaning. My gums never bleed and he never went into my mouth with tools like a normal dental exam he only looked around with the mirror thing and told me I didn’t have any cavities without even using that tool to poke around your teeth. Then he said he was having his office person talk to me about cost of a treatment plan and mentioned a medicated rinse he wants me to do for two weeks then come back to check my gums. When the office lady came in she had a cost sheet that said I would need to pay $361 dollars to proceed to my cleaning. I said what am I paying for because my insurance covers regular and perio cleanings at 100 percent. She said she would itemize it for me...cancer screening $30.00 electric toothbrush $135.00 she could take off and my cost would be $196. I said what is the $196 for if my insurance covers either a regular or perio prophy at 100 percent she said $34 is the medicated rinse and some irrigation that will be needed during the cleaning. So you are trying to bill me to squirt water at my teeth when that is included in what my insurance pays...I just want to get my cleaning done with what my insurance covers either a regular prophylactic or a perio prophy at 100 percent. They refused to do my cleaning without $196 up front. I said that’s ok I will reschedule my cleaning elsewhere. I called their Aspen customer service line and advised them that I would be reporting them to Guardians fraud investigator for trying to up sell. I also reported them refusing to do my cleaning. I advised that I will happily get a 2nd opinion if our fraud investigator needs me to get another opinion in order to build his case. I advised that I actually work with our dental product extensively as an employee of Guardian so I am very much aware about what unsavory dental practices are.This includes performing a panoramic without first discussing it with the patient. I am also reporting this to the Wisconsin Attorney Generals office today, I understand Massachusetts has a successful class action law suit for the same unsavory business practices.",0

I was not happy with this visit. I thought I was getting a cleaning and X-rays and filling. The I was told a cleaning is 600.00 and the filling could not be done until the cleaning was.,0
"I was a little overwhelmed at first but, after the initial process was done and a plan,was agreed upon! The young lady that,helped me with the financial issues was great! The check in nurse Megan, I believe, was terrific! I suffer from depression and anxiety so,this whole process is actually intimidating even at 68 yrs. old! Megan was very understanding of my issues! The receptionist was very polite! The doctor was a breath of fresh air! He showed me the problems and gave me a few options! Overall a good experience! Although, I'm not,looking forward,to having the procedure done! I am excited to be pain free! 😁",0
They were absolutely excellent and very helpful. Office staff to dentist two technicians or 8+ across-the-board!,0

My dentures still feel like they belong to someone else. They are ill fitting and hurt. I would like to talk about what we can do to get them fitting correctly.,0
"My honest opinion. I feel that they dilly dally way too much and looking to find ways to pad the bill rather than just addressing the patient's problem as soon as possible. And I feel $1,600 to pull a $600 tooth is a little excessive. For the patients that are looking for preventive care and a maintenance program that's all well and fine as we should all take care of our teeth and our body but that's not what I was looking for in today's appointment.",0
"Very nice and they were all friendly. Told you what they were going to do before they did it, they made it a pleasant visit.",0
"Lost my top dentures, am 70 years old on Medicare and devoted health plan would like the coast for top dentures please.

I think Aspen Dental is awesome! I had a tooth pulled and the sweet doctor did a great job. No pain at all. I appreciate the supportive staff at Aspen Dental. Thank you all for your big hearts🙋‍♀️💙,0
Reason I said that my mouth is still sore and I think it's because that guy dentist was digging so hard in my gum and steel he did not remove my teeth and then another dentist came in and she started digging in my gums but she got teeth out So with that being said with two people digging down in my gums was not a good experience,0
Oh yeah I forget when the young doctor could not get my teeth out laugh out the room and I'm sitting there with my mouth open waiting for him to return and he never did 5 to 10 minutes went by so I got out the chair went out in the hall he was down that working in someone else's mouth did not have the courtesy to tell me that he could not do the job and someone else was going to take over,0

"Today good but previously not so good.Had two oppointments changed and was not notified and had to drive in the next day to get the appointment.The other time my appoint changed from 3:00 to 2:00 but my card indicated 3:00 but nobody thought so Another wasted trip to office with my 3:00 app card the next day. Another issue is nobody would answer the phone ever for over two weeks, no respond to my messages either. It felt like they were purposely avoiding both. Will continue to see Aspen Dental but make sure I have my card with me so nobody tells me I was mistaken about time of appointment.",0
I liked the doctor bed side manner but I just don't make enough to pay for what has to be done I get Ssi and it's just too much but My doctor was very good and thorough,0
"Walking in the door I was met with a smile and very friendly young man, the young lady who did the x-rays was very friendly and listened to my concerns, the hygienist was very friendly and knowledgeable and the Dr. Was friendly and concerned with how she could help me.

I tried to get a hold of the telephone number that you gave me and was put on hold for quite a while and I have to tell you that I am very disappointed in the service that I have gotten they did a teeth cleaning and charged me $107 And I could have went to my old dentist and got the same cleaning for about $50. My insurance said there should've been no co-pay and yet they figured away to get $107 out of me and like I said I'm very disappointed in my full teeth That I thought with all the technology it would've been a more comfortable with less gaps for food to get underneath my partial,0
I was always with Aspen Dental but the one in Greenville is the best will recommend to family and friends Thanks Jakob,0
I thought the staff was very special and they was very professional. Would recommend them very to everyone. 🥰,0

I love Aspen dental I've never been treated with so much kindness in my experience with a dentist I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Aspen dental in Buford Georgia ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,0
Totally unhappy. I went there with a toothache I left with a toothache. I told them when I made the appointment I wanted an extraction that's what the appointment was for. The only thing Aspen dental did for me today was told me how much a lot of stuff that I never even asked for was going to cost me. It was all about money and my ability to pay for services I did not ask for. So disappointed.,0
Loved the staff at Aspen. They took great care to explain everything. They were so polite and friendly. I will definitely go back.,0

  GONNA THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE I ALLOW MYSELF TO GET SCAMMED WITH THEIR PRICING!

Having to wait a hr on first visit not good having to wait second visit up to 35-40min after arriving both times on time only to be told on 3rd visit arriving 15 min latest (after calling several times and leaving 2 messages that I would be 15-20min late and please call back if that's a issue because it's 60miles round trip for me) got there no one present at front desk, So I waited for a few minutes only to be told ""you need to reschedule since your late"" no hello how are you sorry but no of that just ""mr.wampler you need to reschedule since you were late"" 15min I might add & I called but I get there on time and have to wait 30,45, 60 minutes guess my time is worthless here plus the lack of follow up after first visit was supposed to get a call on fees..ect and had a rupture abscess no one call back after leaving messages and calling 800 number who said they would call back 20 min never happen and a few other issues to many to mention. Perhaps some one would eventually call to at least apologize but the woman was right at the Walmart pharmacy this office is not good at following up and or customer care or communication and those are what I experienced hers was much worse. So yes perhaps someone could follow but not holding my breath. Call 3rd notice no response from anyone at this company ridiculous 😠",0

"Word for today. : Rise up to overcome the obstacles in your way. I have given you the strength and courage to defeat the enemy and walk in victory. You are strong in Me and in the power of My might, says the Lord. Refuse to get discouraged or to accept defeat. You are a mighty warrior dressed for battle. Ephesians 6:12-18 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers ofthe darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench
  all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints. Enjoy your blessed Wednesday!🤗😎🤗",1

"My experience with Fast Pace is always very good. All the personal are
 professionals and do their job thoroughly.
 I recommend the Clinic to my family and friends.
 The only thing that I would love to see changed is the checking in on
 line. I get no where fast with it! I request a code to verify who I
 am...and send the code back and it starts all over again. It's the most
 frustrating program that I have ever dealt with. Can something be done to
 correct this? I don't think that I am the only one with this problem..but
 maybe I am.
 Otherwise, I give the clinic and personal 5 stars!
 

 Most Sincerely,
 Victoria ( Vickie) Fitzpatrick",0

"I'm going to put together a full page to run in next Thursday's PCN for our Wrestling team! I would like to wish the ones that are going to State good luck (obviously, we won't know that until Saturday!) and CONGRATULATE the entire team on their accomplishments this season so far! They have made history!!!!
 

 I will need businesses to purchase 2x1 spaces for $20, or you can buy a double space for $35 to fill up the page below a team photo. If your business would like a space, or two, please let me know as soon as possible!
 

 I will also run a final congratulations the week after state, which will be all businesses that participate in this first page, if they would like. Just let me know if you want the first week, or both. Prices will be the same as above for both pages. Deadline will be Monday, Feb. 13 end of day for the first page.
 

 Thanks for showing our Marksmen your support!!!! THEY DESERVE IT!",0

"A walk-in clinic should be just that. Registering online equates as making appointment, defeating the purpose of ""walk-in"". I witnessed several people leave due to being told there were x number of people ahead of them, therefore a several hours wait to be seen. Seems that if the onliners needed to be seen, they would show at the clinic. Since few, if any, actually showed when clinic opened, I was seen relatively quickly. Staff treated me well and really listened to my concerns.",0
I’m trying to call the phone number is working,0
Will you be open tomorrow due to the holiday?,0
Hello!! I’d like to see if I could make an appointment for approximately 2:45,0

"I need you to be aware of comments made by one of your employee’s, Samantha Candice Dixon, made online in regards to rape victims. She works at the Carthage, TN location. 
 She firmly believes all rape victims should be forced to give birth. She used a 10 year old rape victim as an example it stated it was God’s plan for her to be raped and bare a child. 
 

 

 IMAGINE your daughter was raped. At 10 YEARS OLD and you took her into a medical office and the person checking you in believes you deserve it. 
 

 I have screenshots in her comments. I’ve also let her know I would be contacting you and she didn’t seemed bothered. So, unless something is done with this employee, I will question your integrity and I’d worry for the patients well beings.",0

"My husband and I are the new owners of Skyview Skateshop, located at 49 Union Street in Madisonville, KY. My husband and I recently purchased the business in the hopes to keep the shop alive for the area kids that frequent the shop. We open Tuesday- Saturday where these skaters come and use our free indoor climate controlled mini ramp, and all around hang out. We purchased on Feb 1st and have notice several area kids who want to skate but can't afford the start up. We had one teenage come in with shoes that reminded me of a cartoon character, and we were able to have shoes donated to him. Another broke their board and we knew that they would basically have to stop skating but we had another amazing donor. We have so little in our area for children to enjoy, and one that they look forward to coming to after a long day at school. Several of these kids come from hardship and this is their happy place. We want to be that happy place for other area youth. We currently have 15 skateboard completes with skate tools and wax sponsored waiting to get in the hands to some very deserving kids in our schools. All it takes is $100 to sponsor a board, tool, and wax for a kid that otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity to skate, or one that would have to stop because of circumstances out of their control. 
 

 If you donate, we would post it via social media, and we would make sure the child that received this gift would know who it was from. We would ask if they wanted it posted on social media and with the child's permission post it on our sites as not to embarrass them. I grew up not having much but having a few companies that stepped up and helped kids like me out made me the person I am today. If you donate, we can accept it in most forms (cash, checks, PayPal, Venmo, etc.). No amount is too big or small. Help us keep skate alive and give these kids something that is a positive outlet.
